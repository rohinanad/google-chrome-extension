This project is a clone of the Google search engine.
I made sure to implement all necessary functionalities and for extra credit I created the Poodle Logo myself.
I also changed the file index.html to main-page.html, this was simply for clarification pusposes but if that
is an issue I am happy to change it and I am hoping it does not affect my grade.
